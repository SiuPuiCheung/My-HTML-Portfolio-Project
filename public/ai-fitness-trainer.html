<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>In collaboration with a leading fitness company, I designed the materials of 10 tutorials to introduce secondary school students to the importance of correct posture and the power of pose estimation modelling. Through these tutorials, students will learn to build 6 specific pose estimation models using OpenCV, and MediaPipe with Python.</p>
<p>Each tutorial offers a blend of interactive slides covering posture fundamentals and pose estimation concepts, alongside hands-on coding activities. Students will gain the skills to design their own models, fostering real-world application of computer vision in fitness and injury prevention. A significant portion of the tutorial materials were generated using advanced AI tools like ChatGPT-4, GPT Builders, and GitHub Copilot, showcasing the potential of AI in education.</p>
