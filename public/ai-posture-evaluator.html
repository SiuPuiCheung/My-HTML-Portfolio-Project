<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>Accurate posture estimation during exercises is key for fitness enthusiasts to maximise workout effectiveness and minimize injury risk. To address the limitations of existing posture analysis solutions, I developed a software application for a fitness company that leverages advanced computer vision techniques</p>
<p>The software is designed to analyse video, image or camera input, precisely detecting key body landmarks in real-time. This allows it to accurately evaluate dynamic exercise postures, such as squats and knee raises, from various angles (front, side, back). It calculates joint angles and assesses posture based on pre-defined criteria for correct form, providing users with immediate feedback.</p>

<h3>Highlight</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Developed a custom pose estimation model using MediaPipe and OpenCV</li>
    <li>Built 6 sets of static and dynamic exercises with customised joint detection</li>
    <li>Implemented posture analysis for advanced posture correctness advice</li>
    <li>Designed a user-friendly GUI for the application using Tkinter</li>
    <li>Implemented a feature to generate detailed exercise performance reports</li>
    <li>Deployed the application as a standalone executable using Pyinstaller</li>
